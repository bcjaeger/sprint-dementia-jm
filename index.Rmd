# Background

---

- Few treatments reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment.

- Meta-analyses show a relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and risk for dementia and cognitive impairment, e.g., mid-life hypertension and later onset of dementia.<sup>1, 2</sup>

Some remaining gaps: 
    
- Does lowering SBP associate with reduced risk?

- Does the relationship vary across subgroups?

We consider these questions using data from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial).

# SPRINT

---

A randomized clinical trial (n = 9,361)

- Intervention group targeted SBP < 120 mm Hg (intensive BP control).

- Control group targeted SBP < 140 mm Hg (standard BP control).

---

Adjudicated outcomes included

- Cardiovascular disease

- Probable dementia

- Mild cognitive impairment

---

The trial stopped early due to benefit on cardiovascular outcomes.

- $\Rightarrow$ lower precision for analysis of cognitive outcomes than the investigators planned for. 

- Hazard ratio for probable dementia comparing intensive vs standard BP control was 

 <p><center>0.83 (95% CI 0.67, 1.04)<sup>1</sup></center></p>


- In other words, "No effect" ðŸ¤¦

# Hypothesis

The relationship between SBP and cognitive outcomes can be detected in SPRINT using **joint longitudinal & survival models**.

- Use repeated SBP measurements over time instead of randomization. 

- $\Rightarrow$ Our results show association, not causation.

# Methods

---

*Primary exposure*

- SBP, accounting for changes over time

*Adjudicated cognitive outcomes*

- Probable dementia

- Mild cognitive impairment

*Subgroup analysis* 

- Test for heterogeneity in association of SBP with cognitive outcomes in subgroups defined by age, race, sex, and education.

---

*Longitudinal model for SBP*:

- Random intercepts and polynomial slopes for SBP for each study participant.

- Fixed effects for age, treatment group, time, and treatment by time interaction.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
fit_sbp <- lme(
 fixed = SBP ~ age + poly(time, 2) * treatment_group,
 random = ~ 1 + poly(time, 2) | study_participant,
 data = sprint
)
```


---

*Survival model for cognitive outcomes*:

- Cox proportional hazards with multi-variable adjustment for age group, sex, race, and education at SPRINT baseline exam.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}

fit_surv <- coxph(
 formula = Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex + race + education,
 data = sprint
)

```

---

*Joint longitudinal & survival model* 

- fitted using the `JMBayes2` R package with default priors: 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}

fit_joint <- jm(Surv_object = fit_surv,
                Mixed_objects = fit_sbp,
                time_var = "time",
                id_var = 'study_participant')

# Discussion 

SPRINT found the hazard for probable dementia targeting SBP < 120 vs. < 140 mm Hg was 0.83 (95% CI 0.67, 1.04). 

- We found the hazard ratio per 10 mm Hg lower SBP was 0.83 (95% CI 0.74, 0.93) for probable dementia.

---
# Discussion

Meta-analyses have found SBP is associated with dementia, but the association may vary across subgroups.

- We found no evidence of heterogeneous association for probable dementia

- For mild cognitive impairment we found the association of SBP varied among subgroups defined by education.

---

# Conclusions

1. Lower SBP is associated with decreased risk of both probable dementia and mild cognitive impairment.

2. Joint longitudinal & survival models are useful, accessible, and under utilized tools for studies with longitudinal interventions and event-based outcomes.
